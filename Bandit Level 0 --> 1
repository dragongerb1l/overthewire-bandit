Bandit Level 0 --> 1 

Goal

The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory. 
Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH.
Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.

Commands you may need to solve this level
ls , cd , cat , file , du , find

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Ok so here we are just trying to locate and read the "readme" file that is located in the home directory. 

> In order to see files in linux the command we would use is "ls". 
> This command will show and list the files that are in the directory you are currently in.

## Option	Description for ls Command
-a	Show all files including hidden files (. & ..)
-l	Long listing format (permissions, ownership, size, date)
-h	Human-readable file sizes (used with -l)
-R	Recursively list all subdirectories
-S	Sort by file size, largest first
-t	Sort by modification time, newest first
-r	Reverse the order of sort
-d	List directories themselves, not their contents
-i	Show inode number of each file
-F	Append indicator (/, *, @, etc.) for file types
-p	Append / to directory names
-s	Show file size in blocks
-1	One file per line

> So with the cheat sheet that I've created above I'm going to use the command "ls -alps"
  > I'm doing this so it will:
    - Show hidden files if any (-a) 
    - Create the response in a log list format to make it easier to read (-l)
    - Adds a "/" to directory names (-p)
    - Will show the file size in blocks (s)

> So after using the command "ls -alps" I can clearly see that there is a "readme" file w/ the owner being Bandit1/

> In order to read files we can use the "cat" command 

## The cat command (short for concatenate) is used to:

- Display the contents of files
- Combine multiple files
- Create new files
- Redirect output

##Option	Description
-n	Number all output lines
-b	Number non-blank lines only
-s	Squeeze multiple blank lines into one
-T	Show tabs as ^I
-E	Show $ at the end of each line
-A	Show non-printing characters and combines -vET
-v	Show non-printable characters (excluding tabs and newlines)

> Using the cat command we get a quick Congratulations and the password for the next level.
