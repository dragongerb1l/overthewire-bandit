Bandit Level 3 --> 4

Goal 

The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the inhere directory.

Commands you may need to solve this level
ls , cd , cat , file , du , find

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> The password for the next level is now in a hidden file in another directory.

> We can just use the "ls" commadn to make sure that there is a "inhere" directory

> We see that there is a "inhere" directory

> We are going to use the "cd" command as that command will allow us to change to another directory. "cd inhere" 

> We already know that if we were to just use the "ls" command, no hidden files would show 

> So we are once again going to use old reliable "ls -alps"

> We can now see that there is a file named "...Hiding-From-You" 

> I'm guessing that the ... will mess with the system and just using cat is not going to work

> I was totally wrong and that using the command "cat ...Hiding-From-You" worked and gave us the password for the next lvl
