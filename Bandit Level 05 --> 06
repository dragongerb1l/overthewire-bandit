Bandit Level 5 --> 6

Goal

The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties:

human-readable
1033 bytes in size
not executable
Commands you may need to solve this level
ls , cd , cat , file , du , find

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> So again we see that we need to be in the "inhere" directory to start so we are going to use "cd inhere" to change directories

> I used "ls -alps" to see all the files in the directory. I can see directories named "maybehere00 - maybehere19"

> Again we are given certian properties so we can most likely use filters in order to make the search easier

# I went back to my "find" command cheat sheet and I think I have a soultion to the problem that involes using the past command 
  from last lvl

> I am going to expand on the command that got us the password last lvl

> The command is going to be ;
  find . -type f -size 1033c ! -executable -exec file {} + | grep "ASCII text"

> Breaking it down:
  - Make sure we are searching for files only ( file . -type f) 
  - Size of the file in bytes (-size 1033c) (c is bytes)
  - Not an executable file (! -executable) (! means excude) 
  - Determine file type found (-exec file {} +)
  - Human-readable only (grep "ASCII text")

> After inputting that command we get returned -- 
  ./maybehere07/.file2 

> Need to change directories to maybehere07. cd ./maybehere07

> Here we know that the file we need to open is .file2 

> Use "cat ./.file2 and we open it to the password 

> Password for Bandit6 = HWasnPhtq9AVKe0dmk45nxy20cvUa6EG
