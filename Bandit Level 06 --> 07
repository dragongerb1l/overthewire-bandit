owned by user bandit7
owned by group bandit6
33 bytes in size

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> This is the first time that we are not directed to a certian directory or file. 
  I used "ls -alps" because its just secondhand nature at this point. Nothing came up file or direcorty wise

> So I'm guessing we will use the find command again and basically use the same final command we used last lvl
  I just need to find the correct commands for owned by user and group

> I'm going to try: 
  find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 

> Ok so that seemed to work, alot of files came up and ended with permission denied expect one file:
  var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
*there must be a way to minimize what was shown to me, could have maybe included a command to exclude files that = permissioned denied

> Anyway with the file we have I'm just going to cat the file and yup we got the password

> Password for Bandit7 = morbNTDkSW6jIlUc0ymOdMaLnOlFVAaj
