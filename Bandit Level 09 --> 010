Bandit Level 9 --> 10

Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt in one of the few human-readable strings, preceded by several ‘=’ characters.

Commands you may need to solve this level
grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> This time the string that is only human-readable contains a couple of '=' 

> Going to try something similar like last time 

> sort data.txt | uniq -c "="
  - idea behind this is we are sorting the txt file and finding '=' and printing those strngs out 

> Didn't work how I thought, maybe overthinking, going to try grep. Also don't think I can sort this due to encoded text. 
  Going to replace sort with strings

> Going to try " strings data.txt | grep "="

# Looking more into strings command:
    The strings command in Linux is used to extract human-readable text (printable ASCII characters) from binary files. 
    It’s especially useful when analyzing executable files, memory dumps, 
    or other non-text files to find embedded strings such as passwords, URLs, or error messages

Command	Description
strings file.bin	// Prints readable strings in file.bin
strings -n 6 file	// Shows only strings 6 characters or longer
strings /bin/ls	// Extracts strings from the ls binary
strings -t x file	// Shows the offset (in hex) of each string
strings -e l file	// Assumes little-endian encoding for wide characters

> Tried the strings data.txt | grep "=" command and got back some encrpyted strings but since some have 
  readable text it showed the password
