> I can see that there is a "-" file so again I am going to try to access the file 

> I tried to use the cat command in order to open it but it didn't work, as expected I felt as the game would try to make

# Google has suggested that I use "./" in front of the hyphen in order for it to refer it as the file.

> I will now use the "cat ./-" command to see if that will open the file.

> It has opened the file and given me the password for Bandit2 which is - 263JGJPfgU6LtdEvgfWU1XP5yac29mFx
