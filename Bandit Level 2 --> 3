Bandit Level 2 --> 

Goal 

The password for the next level is stored in a file called spaces in this filename located in the home directory

Commands you may need to solve this level
ls , cd , cat , file , du , find

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Once again the password is located in a file.

> We will once again use the command "ls -alps" 

> Again we see all the files in the home directory and specifically "spaces in this filename" file

> So just looking at it I can tell the spaces in the filename is the problem I'll face in this level

# One quick google search later and it seems that we need to "escape the spaces" in the filename so the 
  shell does not not treat them like seperate arguments. We can use "\" after the last letter of each word

> With this information I am going to try the command " cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename

> It worked! The file is open and the password is shown

> Password for Bandit3 = MNk8KNH3Usiio41PRUEoDFPqfxLPlSmx
