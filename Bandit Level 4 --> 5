Bandit Level 4 --> 5

Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory. 
Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command.

Commands you may need to solve this level
ls , cd , cat , file , du , find

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> First things first we must switch to the "inhere" directory. "cd inhere"

> I'm again going to use the "ls -alps" command to see the files listed. 
  I'm hoping something will pop up indicting which file is human-readable

> Files from -file00 to -file09 appeared, no clues on what is human-readable and non human-readable

> Used "cat ./-file00" in order to see what the file contain. Definitely not human-readable. 
  I could go though each file individually, but I feel there can be more efficent ways

# Using the suggested above on what command might be helpful I looked more into the find command

  # Find Command Cheat Sheet 

  find .	// List all files and directories recursively from the current directory
  find /path/to/search -name "filename"	// Find file by exact name
  find . -iname "file.txt"	// Case-insensitive search
  find . -type f	// Find only files
  find . -type d	// Find only directories
  find . -name "*.txt"	// Find all .txt files
  find . -size +1M	// Files larger than 1 MB
  find . -size -500k	// Files smaller than 500 KB
  find . -empty  // Find empty files and directories
  find . -perm 777	//   Files with 777 permissions
  find . -mtime -7	// Modified in the last 7 days
  find . -atime +30	// Accessed more than 30 days ago

# Using find is only the first portion of the command we need to use "|" in order to use the output of one command 
  and use it as the input for another

# Also was pointed in my searches to look into using the Grep command 

# grep (Global Regular Expression Print) searches for lines matching a pattern in files or output.

# Command	Description
grep "hello" file.txt	// Find lines containing "hello" in file.txt
grep -i "hello" file.txt	// Case-insensitive search
grep -r "hello" .	// Recursively search in current directory
grep -l "hello" *.txt	// Show only filenames with matches
grep -n "hello" file.txt	// Show line numbers of matches
grep -v "hello" file.txt	// Invert match (show lines not containing "hello")
grep -c "hello" file.txt	// Count number of matching lines
grep -w "hello" file.txt	// Match the whole word “hello”
grep -A 3 "hello" file.txt	// Show 3 lines after match
grep -B 2 "hello" file.txt	// Show 2 lines before match
grep -C 2 "hello" file.txt	// Show 2 lines before and after match

## I create the cheatsheets for a bunch of the common uses of the commands not all of them 
  I will use the "man" command in order to find out more uses for a specific command

> Ok so with the infomation I got from google and the manuel page I am going to use:
  find . type -f -exec file {} + | grep "ASCII text"
