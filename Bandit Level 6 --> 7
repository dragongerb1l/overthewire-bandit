The password for the next level is stored somewhere on the server and has all of the following properties:

owned by user bandit7
owned by group bandit6
33 bytes in size

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> This is the first time that we are not directed to a certian directory or file. 
  I used "ls -alps" because its just secondhand nature at this point. Nothing came up file or direcorty wise

> So I'm guessing we will use the find command again and basically use the same final command we used last lvl
  I just need to find the correct commands for owned by user and group

> I'm going to try: 
  find . -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c
