Bandit Level 8 --> 9

Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt and is the only line of text that occurs only once

Commands you may need to solve this level
grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Ok so again we the data.txt file and this time we are looking for a line that occurs only once

> Again looking at the suggested commands uniq is speaking to me as it sounds like it finds things that are well unique

> I think I should stick with the sort command and then grep it with uniq, going to man uniq to find option for unique

> Found -u for printing uniqu lines, who would have guessed

> So lets try sort data.txt | uniq -u

> Tried the command and we got spit out a string that looks like the password
