OverTheWire - Bandit

I will be documenting how I am learning and expanding my Linux knowledge by completing CTF's and in this case I will be using OverTheWire Wargames. 

The First Wargame OverTheWire suugests is Bandit.The Bandit wargame is aimed at absolute beginners. It will teach the basics needed to be able to play other wargames.

I will go through my steps on completing each level. Whether its me figuring out how to capture the flag muself or explaining how I googled soultions to help me capture the flags. 

I will create a new file for each level that will start with all the information the wargame gives the user in order to complete the level. I have some basic knowledge on Linux already so some commands may be known already. 

In the files I will use a ">" to indicate the steps I took to solve the level 
I will use a "#" in order to show outsourcing I used to learn and create cheat sheets
