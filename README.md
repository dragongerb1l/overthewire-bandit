OverTheWire - Bandit

I will be documenting how I am learning and expanding my Linux knowledge by completing CTF's and in this case I will be using OverTheWire Wargames. 

The First Wargame OverTheWire suugests is Bandit.The Bandit wargame is aimed at absolute beginners. It will teach the basics needed to be able to play other wargames.

I will go through my steps on completing each level. Whether its me figuring out how to capture the flag muself or explaining how I googled soultions to help me capture the flags.
